## Objectives
##### The objective of this assignment is to be able to provide a working version of the Wa-Tor simulation with Sharks and Fish interacting as expected in the documentation

## Issues & how I solved them
##### The first big issue I ran into was how to randomise the layout of the grid initially. The solution that I found for this was by entering all of the sharks and fish into a grid the size of the simulation and then using rand.shuffle to jumble up the order that they were being displayed in. ChatGPT gave me this idea and then I researched how it works from here (https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand#Shuffle) as well

##### The next big issue that I ran into was how to get the sharks and fish moving. This issue was solved by using a formula that was generated by ChatGPT for the area to the north,south,east and west of the current fish/shark which I could then assign the fish/shark value to the correct value depending on what was in that area.

##### The next issue I faced in building this simulation is that I dont think the fish are being handled correctly. I am still currently working on this.
