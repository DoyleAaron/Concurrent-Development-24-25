## Objectives
##### The objective of this assignment is to be able to provide a working version of the Wa-Tor simulation with Sharks and Fish interacting as expected in the documentation

## Issues & how I solved them
##### The first big issue I ran into was how to randomise the layout of the grid initially. The solution that I found for this was by entering all of the sharks and fish into a grid the size of the simulation and then using rand.shuffle to jumble up the order that they were being displayed in. ChatGPT gave me this idea and then I researched how it works from here (https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand#Shuffle) as well

##### The next big issue that I ran into was how to get the sharks and fish moving. This issue was solved by using a formula that was generated by ChatGPT for the area to the north,south,east and west of the current fish/shark which I could then assign the fish/shark value to the correct value depending on what was in that area.

##### The next issue I faced in building this simulation is that I dont think the fish are being handled correctly asthey just disappear immediately. This ended up being due to how I was storing the grid as I wasn't copying it correctly which caused them to flash up for a second and then disappear.

##### The next issue I faced is that the sharks aren't dying once they hit their starvation point. This was due to the fact that I didn't check if it was less than the value of 0 and I added in the continue keyword so that it would skip the rest of the logic for the sharks if it had already starved.
