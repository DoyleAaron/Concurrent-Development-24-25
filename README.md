## Lab 1 
##### To run the roman numerals file, you can run it through the terminal using the command 'python romanNumerals.py' 

## Lab 3   
##### This is a go example of a barrier that prints a's and b's consecutively. To run this file navigate to the lab 3 folder and run the command go run barrier.go

## Lab 4   
##### This is a continuation of the previous lab where I am making the barrier reusable. To run this file navigate to the lab 4 folder and run the command go run barrier.go

## Lab 5
##### This is a simple example of how the producer consumer problem works and how you can prevent it using channels and mutex locks. To run this file navigate to the lab5 folder and run the command go run producerConsumer.go

## Lab 6
##### This is a go example of how to solve the Dining Philosophers problem. This was achieved by splitting them into evens and odds to ensure that the philosophers wouldn't try and grab the same forks at the same time. This was ensured by making sure that the philosophers picked up the forks in different orders depending on whether they were in the even or odd group too to prevent a case of a deadlock. This file can be ran by navigating to the lab6 folder and running the command go run dining-philosophers.go
